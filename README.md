**openair** is an R package developed for the purpose of analysing air quality data — or more generally atmospheric composition data. The package is extensively used in academia, the public and private sectors. The project was initially funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council ([NERC](https://www.ukri.org/councils/nerc/)), with additional funds from the UK Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs ([Defra](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs)).

## 💡 Core Features

**openair** has developed over many years to form an extensive toolkit of functions for analysing air quality and atmospheric composition data.

- **Access to data** from several hundred UK air pollution monitoring sites through the `importUKAQ()` family of functions.

- **Time Series & Trend analysis** to explore how air quality concentrations vary over time (e.g., through `timePlot()`, `timeVariation()`, and `calendarPlot()`).

- **Directional analysis** to help characterise different sources of pollution, including the creation of **bivariate polar plots** using `polarPlot()`.

- **Trajectory analysis** to examine NOAA Hysplit trajectories, with plotting (`trajPlot()`), heatmap (`trajLevel()`) and clustering (`trajCluster()`) functionality.

- **Utility functions**, such as `timeAverage()` and `selectByDate()` to make it easier to manipulate atmospheric composition data.

- **Flexible plot conditioning** to easily plot data by hour or the day, day of the week, season of the year, etc., through the `type` option available in most functions.

## 📖 Documentation

All **openair** functions are fully documented; access documentation using R in your IDE of choice.

```r
?openair::polarPlot
```

Documentation is also hosted online on the **package website**.

A guide to the openair toolkit can be found in the **online book**, which contains lots of code snippets, demonstrations of functionality, and ideas for the application of **openair**'s various functions.
