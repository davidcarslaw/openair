**openair** is an R package developed for the purpose of analysing air quality data ‚Äî or more generally atmospheric composition data. The package is extensively used in academia, the public and private sectors. The project was initially funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council ([NERC](https://www.ukri.org/councils/nerc/)), with additional funds from the UK Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs ([Defra](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs)).

## üí° Core Features

**openair** has developed over many years to form an extensive toolkit of functions for analysing air quality and atmospheric composition data.

- **Access to data** from several hundred UK air pollution monitoring sites through the `importUKAQ()` family of functions.

- **Time Series & Trend analysis** to explore how air quality concentrations vary over time (e.g., through `timePlot()`, `timeVariation()`, and `calendarPlot()`).

- **Directional analysis** to help characterise different sources of pollution, including the creation of **bivariate polar plots** using `polarPlot()`.

- **Trajectory analysis** to examine NOAA Hysplit trajectories, with plotting (`trajPlot()`), heatmap (`trajLevel()`) and clustering (`trajCluster()`) functionality.

- **Utility functions**, such as `timeAverage()` and `selectByDate()` to make it easier to manipulate atmospheric composition data.

- **Flexible plot conditioning** to easily plot data by hour or the day, day of the week, season of the year, etc., through the `type` option available in most functions.

## üìñ Documentation

All **openair** functions are fully documented; access documentation using R in your IDE of choice.

```r
?openair::polarPlot
```

Documentation is also hosted online on the **package website**.

A guide to the openair toolkit can be found in the **online book**, which contains lots of code snippets, demonstrations of functionality, and ideas for the application of **openair**'s various functions.
