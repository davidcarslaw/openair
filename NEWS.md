The function can consider Pearson correlation and slopes from ordinary linear regression, robust regression (using **MASS** function `rlm`) and quantile regression (requires the **quantreg** package to be installed). See [open access version](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231016307166) of the paper.

	... handling

# openair 0.5-6

	optional smoothing, plus other code clean-ups
* 	fix bug in conditionalQuantile that labelled plots wrongly
	when site(s) has missing data

	annotate the plot properly with period = "trend" and less than 1 year
	of data; improved smoothing default options used

	to counts and contribution to the mean. The latter is useful for
	displaying those wind directions that make most contribution to teh
	overall mean. Panel mean is also now shown.
* 	small change to final example of re-shaping data in `importKCL`
* 	`timeAverage` can now expand data to shorter time periods
	e.g. hourly to 15-minute. This makes it more flexible to combine data
	sets with differeing averging times. For example, daily mean particle

	meteorological data set.
* 	Fix treatment of calms in checkPrep, which affected cases with
	zero wind speeds in `timeAverage`
*	Fix to vector averaging in `timeAverage` (did not include wind

*	use avg.time in calcPercentile instead of 'period' to ensure
	consistency with other functions (`timePlot` would fail with
	percentiles)
*	return NA in aqStats when no data present; previously it tried
	to calculate quanities, returning -Inf etc

# openair 0.4-17 

*	use readRDS and not .readRDS (caused failure on R Dev)
