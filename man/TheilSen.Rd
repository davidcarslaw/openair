\arguments{
\item{mydata}{A data frame containing the field \code{date} and at least one
other parameter for which a trend test is required; typically (but not
necessarily) a pollutant.}

\item{pollutant}{The parameter for which a trend test is required.
Mandatory.}

\item{deseason}{Should the data be de-deasonalized first? If \code{TRUE} the
function \code{stl} is used (seasonal trend decomposition using loess).
Note that if \code{TRUE} missing data are first imputed using a
Kalman filter and Kalman smooth.}

\item{type}{\code{type} determines how the data are split i.e. conditioned,
and then plotted. The default is will produce a single plot using the
entire data. Type can be one of the built-in types as detailed in
\code{cutData} e.g. \dQuote{season}, \dQuote{year}, \dQuote{weekday} and
so on. For example, \code{type = "season"} will produce four plots --- one
for each season.

It is also possible to choose \code{type} as another variable in the data
frame. If that variable is numeric, then the data will be split into four
quantiles (if possible) and labelled accordingly. If type is an existing
character or factor variable, then those categories/levels will be used
directly. This offers great flexibility for understanding the variation of
different variables and how they depend on one another.

Type can be up length two e.g. \code{type = c("season", "weekday")} will
produce a 2x2 plot split by season and day of the week. Note, when two
types are provided the first forms the columns and the second the rows.}

\item{avg.time}{Can be \dQuote{month} (the default), \dQuote{season} or
\dQuote{year}. Determines the time over which data should be averaged.
Note that for \dQuote{year}, six or more years are required. For
\dQuote{season} the data are split up into spring: March, April, May etc.
Note that December is considered as belonging to winter of the following
year.}

\item{statistic}{Statistic used for calculating monthly values. Default is
\dQuote{mean}, but can also be \dQuote{percentile}. See \code{timeAverage}
for more details.}

\item{percentile}{Single percentile value to use if \code{statistic =
"percentile"} is chosen.}

\item{data.thresh}{The data capture threshold to use (\%) when aggregating
the data using \code{avg.time}. A value of zero means that all available
data will be used in a particular period regardless if of the number of
values available. Conversely, a value of 100 will mean that all data will
need to be present for the average to be calculated, else it is recorded
as \code{NA}.}

\item{alpha}{For the confidence interval calculations of the slope. The
default is 0.05. To show 99\\% confidence intervals for the value of the
trend, choose alpha = 0.01 etc.}

\item{dec.place}{The number of decimal places to display the trend estimate
at. The default is 2.}

\item{xlab}{x-axis label, by default \code{"year"}.}

\item{lab.frac}{Fraction along the y-axis that the trend information should
be printed at, default 0.99.}

\item{lab.cex}{Size of text for trend information.}

\item{x.relation}{This determines how the x-axis scale is plotted.
\dQuote{same} ensures all panels use the same scale and \dQuote{free} will
use panel-specific scales. The latter is a useful setting when plotting
data with very different values.}

\item{y.relation}{This determines how the y-axis scale is plotted.
\dQuote{same} ensures all panels use the same scale and \dQuote{free} will
use panel-specific scales. The latter is a useful setting when plotting
data with very different values.}

\item{data.col}{Colour name for the data}

\item{trend}{list containing information on the line width, line type and
line colour for the main trend line and confidence intervals respectively.}

\item{text.col}{Colour name for the slope/uncertainty numeric estimates}

\item{slope.text}{The text shown for the slope (default is
\sQuote{units/year}).}

\item{cols}{Predefined colour scheme, currently only enabled for
\code{"greyscale"}.}

\item{shade}{The colour used for marking alternate years. Use \dQuote{white}
or \dQuote{transparent} to remove shading.}

\item{auto.text}{Either \code{TRUE} (default) or \code{FALSE}. If
\code{TRUE} titles and axis labels will automatically try and format
pollutant names and units properly e.g.  by subscripting the \sQuote{2} in
NO2.}

\item{autocor}{Should autocorrelation be considered in the trend uncertainty
estimates? The default is \code{FALSE}. Generally, accounting for
autocorrelation increases the uncertainty of the trend estimate ---
sometimes by a large amount.}

\item{slope.percent}{Should the slope and the slope uncertainties be
expressed as a percentage change per year? The default is \code{FALSE} and
the slope is expressed as an average units/year change e.g. ppb.
Percentage changes can often be confusing and should be clearly defined.
Here the percentage change is expressed as 100 * (C.end/C.start - 1) /
(end.year - start.year). Where C.start is the concentration at the start
date and C.end is the concentration at the end date.

For \code{avg.time = "year"} (end.year - start.year) will be the total
number of years - 1. For example, given a concentration in year 1 of 100
units and a percentage reduction of 5\%/yr, after 5 years there will be 75
units but the actual time span will be 6 years i.e. year 1 is used as a
reference year. Things are slightly different for monthly values e.g.
\code{avg.time = "month"}, which will use the total number of months as a
basis of the time span and is therefore able to deal with partial years.
There can be slight differences in the \%/yr trend estimate therefore,
depending on whether monthly or annual values are considered.}

\item{date.breaks}{Number of major x-axis intervals to use. The function
will try and choose a sensible number of dates/times as well as formatting
the date/time appropriately to the range being considered. This does not
always work as desired automatically. The user can therefore increase or
decrease the number of intervals by adjusting the value of
\code{date.breaks} up or down.}

\item{date.format}{This option controls the date format on the
x-axis. While \code{TheilSen} generally sets the date format
sensibly there can be some situations where the user wishes to
have more control. For format types see \code{strptime}. For
example, to format the date like \dQuote{Jan-2012} set
\code{date.format = "\%b-\%Y"}.}

\item{plot}{Should a plot be produced? \code{FALSE} can be useful when
analysing data to extract trend components and plotting them in other
ways.}

\item{silent}{When \code{FALSE} the function will give updates on
trend-fitting progress.}

\item{...}{Other graphical parameters passed onto \code{cutData} and
\code{lattice:xyplot}. For example, \code{TheilSen} passes the option
\code{hemisphere = "southern"} on to \code{cutData} to provide southern
(rather than default northern) hemisphere handling of \code{type =
  "season"}. Similarly, common axis and title labelling options (such as
\code{xlab}, \code{ylab}, \code{main}) are passed to \code{xyplot} via
\code{quickText} to handle routine formatting.}

\value{
an \link[=openair-package]{openair} object. The \code{data} component of the
\code{TheilSen} output includes two subsets: \code{main.data}, the monthly
data \code{res2} the trend statistics. For \code{output <- TheilSen(mydata,
  "nox")}, these can be extracted as \code{object$data$main.data} and
\code{object$data$res2}, respectively. Note: In the case of the intercept,
it is assumed the y-axis crosses the x-axis on 1/1/1970.

Theil-Sen slope estimates and tests for trend.

\details{
The \code{TheilSen} function provides a collection of functions to
analyse trends in air pollution data. The \code{TheilSen} function
is flexible in the sense that it can be applied to data in many
ways e.g. by day of the week, hour of day and wind direction. This
flexibility makes it much easier to draw inferences from data
e.g. why is there a strong downward trend in concentration from
one wind sector and not another, or why trends on one day of the
week or a certain time of day are unexpected.

For data that are strongly seasonal, perhaps from a background
site, or a pollutant such as ozone, it will be important to
deseasonalise the data (using the option \code{deseason =
TRUE}.Similarly, for data that increase, then decrease, or show
sharp changes it may be better to use \code{\link{smoothTrend}}.

A minimum of 6 points are required for trend estimates to be made.

Note! that since version 0.5-11 openair uses Theil-Sen to derive
the p values also for the slope. This is to ensure there is
consistency between the calculated p value and other trend
parameters i.e. slope estimates and uncertainties. The p value and
all uncertainties are calculated through bootstrap simulations.

Note that the symbols shown next to each trend estimate relate to
how statistically significant the trend estimate is: p $<$ 0.001 =
***, p $<$ 0.01 = **, p $<$ 0.05 = * and p $<$ 0.1 = $+$.

Some of the code used in \code{TheilSen} is based on that from
Rand Wilcox. This mostly
relates to the Theil-Sen slope estimates and uncertainties.
Further modifications have been made to take account of correlated
data based on Kunsch (1989). The basic function has been adapted
to take account of auto-correlated data using block bootstrap
simulations if \code{autocor = TRUE} (Kunsch, 1989). We follow the
suggestion of Kunsch (1989) of setting the block length to n(1/3)
where n is the length of the time series.

The slope estimate and confidence intervals in the slope are plotted and
numerical information presented.
