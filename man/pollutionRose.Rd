\usage{
pollutionRose(
  mydata,
  pollutant = "nox",
  key.footer = pollutant,
  key.position = "right",
  key = TRUE,
  breaks = 6,
  paddle = FALSE,
  seg = 0.9,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{mydata}{A data frame containing fields \code{ws} and \code{wd}}

\item{pollutant}{Mandatory. A pollutant name corresponding to a variable in a
data frame should be supplied e.g. \code{pollutant = "nox"}.}

\item{key.footer}{Adds additional text/labels below the scale key. See
\code{key.header} for further information.}

\item{key.position}{Location where the scale key is to plotted. Allowed
arguments currently include \dQuote{top}, \dQuote{right}, \dQuote{bottom}
and \dQuote{left}.}

\item{key}{Fine control of the scale key via \code{\link[=drawOpenKey]{drawOpenKey()}}.}

\item{breaks}{Most commonly, the number of break points for pollutant
concentrations. The default, 6, attempts to breaks the supplied data at
approximately 6 sensible break points. However, \code{breaks} can also be
used to set specific break points. For example, the argument \code{breaks =
  c(0, 1, 10, 100)} breaks the data into segments <1, 1-10, 10-100, >100.}

\item{paddle}{Either \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE} plots rose
using 'paddle' style spokes. If \code{FALSE} plots rose using 'wedge' style
spokes.}

\item{seg}{When \code{paddle = TRUE}, \code{seg} determines with width of the
segments. For example, \code{seg = 0.5} will produce segments 0.5 *
\code{angle}.}

\item{normalise}{If \code{TRUE} each wind direction segment is normalised to
equal one. This is useful for showing how the concentrations (or other
parameters) contribute to each wind sector when the proportion of time the
wind is from that direction is low. A line showing the probability that the
wind directions is from a particular wind sector is also shown.}

\item{alpha}{The alpha transparency to use for the plotting surface (a value
between 0 and 1 with zero being fully transparent and 1 fully opaque).
Setting a value below 1 can be useful when plotting surfaces on a map using
the package \code{openairmaps}.}

\item{plot}{Should a plot be produced? \code{FALSE} can be useful when
analysing data to extract plot components and plotting them in other ways.}

\item{...}{
  Arguments passed on to \code{\link[=windRose]{windRose}}
  \describe{
    \item{\code{ws}}{Name of the column representing wind speed.}
    \item{\code{wd}}{Name of the column representing wind direction.}
    \item{\code{ws2,wd2}}{The user can supply a second set of wind speed and wind
direction values with which the first can be compared. See
\code{\link[=pollutionRose]{pollutionRose()}} for more details.}
    \item{\code{ws.int}}{The Wind speed interval. Default is 2 m/s but for low met masts
with low mean wind speeds a value of 1 or 0.5 m/s may be better.}
    \item{\code{angle}}{Default angle of \dQuote{spokes} is 30. Other potentially useful
angles are 45 and 10. Note that the width of the wind speed interval may
need adjusting using \code{width}.}
    \item{\code{type}}{\code{type} determines how the data are split i.e. conditioned,
and then plotted. The default is will produce a single plot using the
entire data. Type can be one of the built-in types as detailed in
\code{cutData} e.g. \dQuote{season}, \dQuote{year}, \dQuote{weekday} and so
on. For example, \code{type = "season"} will produce four plots --- one for
each season.

It is also possible to choose \code{type} as another variable in the data
frame. If that variable is numeric, then the data will be split into four
quantiles (if possible) and labelled accordingly. If type is an existing
character or factor variable, then those categories/levels will be used
directly. This offers great flexibility for understanding the variation of
different variables and how they depend on one another.

Type can be up length two e.g. \code{type = c("season", "weekday")} will
produce a 2x2 plot split by season and day of the week. Note, when two
types are provided the first forms the columns and the second the rows.}
    \item{\code{calm.thresh}}{By default, conditions are considered to be calm when the
wind speed is zero. The user can set a different threshold for calms be
setting \code{calm.thresh} to a higher value. For example,
\code{calm.thresh = 0.5} will identify wind speeds \strong{below} 0.5 as calm.}
    \item{\code{bias.corr}}{When \code{angle} does not divide exactly into 360 a bias is
introduced in the frequencies when the wind direction is already supplied
rounded to the nearest 10 degrees, as is often the case. For example, if
\code{angle = 22.5}, N, E, S, W will include 3 wind sectors and all other
angles will be two. A bias correction can made to correct for this problem.
A simple method according to Applequist (2012) is used to adjust the
frequencies.}
    \item{\code{cols}}{Colours to be used for plotting. Options include
\dQuote{default}, \dQuote{increment}, \dQuote{heat}, \dQuote{jet},
\dQuote{hue} and user defined. For user defined the user can supply a list
of colour names recognised by R (type \code{colours()} to see the full
list). An example would be \code{cols = c("yellow", "green", "blue",
  "black")}.}
    \item{\code{grid.line}}{Grid line interval to use. If \code{NULL}, as in default,
this is assigned based on the available data range. However, it can also be
forced to a specific value, e.g. \code{grid.line = 10}. \code{grid.line}
can also be a list to control the interval, line type and colour. For
example \code{grid.line = list(value = 10, lty = 5, col = "purple")}.}
    \item{\code{width}}{For \code{paddle = TRUE}, the adjustment factor for width of
wind speed intervals. For example, \code{width = 1.5} will make the paddle
width 1.5 times wider.}
    \item{\code{auto.text}}{Either \code{TRUE} (default) or \code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE}
titles and axis labels will automatically try and format pollutant names
and units properly, e.g., by subscripting the \sQuote{2} in NO2.}
    \item{\code{offset}}{The size of the 'hole' in the middle of the plot, expressed as
a percentage of the polar axis scale, default 10.}
    \item{\code{max.freq}}{Controls the scaling used by setting the maximum value for
the radial limits. This is useful to ensure several plots use the same
radial limits.}
    \item{\code{key.header}}{Adds additional text/labels above the scale key. For
example, passing \code{windRose(mydata, key.header = "ws")} adds the
addition text as a scale header. Note: This argument is passed to
\code{\link[=drawOpenKey]{drawOpenKey()}} via \code{\link[=quickText]{quickText()}}, applying the auto.text argument, to
handle formatting.}
    \item{\code{dig.lab}}{The number of significant figures at which scientific number
formatting is used in break point and key labelling. Default 5.}
    \item{\code{include.lowest}}{Logical. If \code{FALSE} (the default), the first
interval will be left exclusive and right inclusive. If \code{TRUE}, the
first interval will be left and right inclusive. Passed to the
\code{include.lowest} argument of \code{\link[=cut]{cut()}}.}
    \item{\code{statistic}}{The \code{statistic} to be applied to each data bin in the
plot. Options currently include \dQuote{prop.count}, \dQuote{prop.mean} and
\dQuote{abs.count}. The default \dQuote{prop.count} sizes bins according to
the proportion of the frequency of measurements.  Similarly,
\dQuote{prop.mean} sizes bins according to their relative contribution to
the mean. \dQuote{abs.count} provides the absolute count of measurements in
each bin.}
    \item{\code{annotate}}{If \code{TRUE} then the percentage calm and mean values are
printed in each panel together with a description of the statistic below
the plot. If \code{" "} then only the statistic is below the plot. Custom
annotations may be added by setting value to \code{c("annotation 1",
  "annotation 2")}.}
    \item{\code{angle.scale}}{The scale is by default shown at a 315 degree angle.
Sometimes the placement of the scale may interfere with an interesting
feature. The user can therefore set \code{angle.scale} to another value
(between 0 and 360 degrees) to mitigate such problems. For example
\code{angle.scale = 45} will draw the scale heading in a NE direction.}
    \item{\code{border}}{Border colour for shaded areas. Default is no border.}

\value{
an \link[=openair-package]{openair} object. Summarised proportions can be
extracted directly using the \code{$data} operator, e.g.
\code{object$data} for \code{output <- windRose(mydata)}. This returns a
data frame with three set columns: \code{cond}, conditioning based on
\code{type}; \code{wd}, the wind direction; and \code{calm}, the
\code{statistic} for the proportion of data unattributed to any specific
wind direction because it was collected under calm conditions; and then
several (one for each range binned for the plot) columns giving proportions
of measurements associated with each \code{ws} or \code{pollutant} range
plotted as a discrete panel.
}
\description{
The traditional wind rose plot that plots wind speed and wind direction by
different intervals. The pollution rose applies the same plot structure but
substitutes other measurements, most commonly a pollutant time series, for
wind speed.
}
\details{
\code{\link[=pollutionRose]{pollutionRose()}} is a \code{\link[=windRose]{windRose()}} wrapper which brings \code{pollutant}
forward in the argument list, and attempts to sensibly rescale break points
based on the \code{pollutant} data range by by-passing \code{ws.int}.

By default, \code{\link[=pollutionRose]{pollutionRose()}} will plot a pollution rose of \code{nox} using
"wedge" style segments and placing the scale key to the right of the plot.

It is possible to compare two wind speed-direction data sets using
\code{\link[=pollutionRose]{pollutionRose()}}. There are many reasons for doing so e.g. to see how one
site compares with another or for meteorological model evaluation. In this
case, \code{ws} and \code{wd} are considered to the the reference data sets
with which a second set of wind speed and wind directions are to be compared
(\code{ws2} and \code{wd2}). The first set of values is subtracted from the
second and the differences compared. If for example, \code{wd2} was biased
positive compared with \code{wd} then \code{pollutionRose} will show the bias
in polar coordinates. In its default use, wind direction bias is colour-coded
to show negative bias in one colour and positive bias in another.

\examples{
# pollutionRose of nox
pollutionRose(mydata, pollutant = "nox")

## source apportionment plot - contribution to mean
\dontrun{
pollutionRose(mydata, pollutant = "pm10", type = "year", statistic = "prop.mean")
}

## example of comparing 2 met sites
## first we will make some new ws/wd data with a postive bias
mydata$ws2 = mydata$ws + 2 * rnorm(nrow(mydata)) + 1
mydata$wd2 = mydata$wd + 30 * rnorm(nrow(mydata)) + 30

## need to correct negative wd
id <- which(mydata$wd2 < 0)
mydata$wd2[id] <- mydata$wd2[id] + 360

## results show postive bias in wd and ws
pollutionRose(mydata, ws = "ws", wd = "wd", ws2 = "ws2", wd2 = "wd2")
