\usage{
importKCL(
  site = "my1",
  year = 2009,
  pollutant = "all",
  met = FALSE,
  units = "mass",
  extra = FALSE,
  meta = FALSE,
  to_narrow = FALSE,
  progress = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{site}{Site code of the network site to import e.g. "my1" is Marylebone
Road. Several sites can be imported with \code{site = c("my1", "kc1")} ---
to import Marylebone Road and North Kensignton for example.}

\item{year}{Year(s) to import. To import a series of years use, e.g.,
\code{2000:2020}. To import several specific years use \code{year = c(2000, 2010, 2020)}.}

\item{pollutant}{Pollutants to import. If omitted will import all pollutants
from a site. To import only NOx and NO2 for example use \code{pollutant =
  c("nox", "no2")}. Pollutant names can be upper or lower case.}

\item{met}{Should meteorological data be added to the import data? The
default is \code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE} wind speed (m/s), wind direction
(degrees), solar radiation and rain amount are available. See details
below.}

\item{units}{By default the returned data frame expresses the units in mass
terms (ug/m3 for NOx, NO2, O3, SO2; mg/m3 for CO). Use \code{units =
  "volume"} to use ppb etc. PM10_raw TEOM data are multiplied by 1.3 and
PM2.5 have no correction applied. See details below concerning PM10
concentrations.}

\item{extra}{Not currently used.}

\item{meta}{Append the site type, latitude and longitude of each selected
\code{site}? Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{to_narrow}{Return the data in a "narrow"/"long"/"tidy" format? By
default the returned data is "wide" and has a column for each
pollutant/variable. When \code{to_narrow = TRUE} the data are returned with a
column identifying the pollutant name and a column containing the
corresponding concentration/statistic. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{progress}{Show a progress bar when many sites/years are being imported?
Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame of hourly mean values with date in POSIXct
class and time zone GMT.

\description{
Function for importing hourly mean data from King's College London networks.
Files are imported from a remote server operated by King's College London
that provides air quality data files as R data objects.
}
\details{
The \code{importKCL} function has been written to make it easy to import
data from the King's College London air pollution networks. KCL have
provided .RData files (R workspaces) of all individual sites and years for
the KCL networks. These files are updated on a weekly basis. This approach
requires a link to the Internet to work.

There are several advantages over the web portal approach where .csv files
are downloaded. First, it is quick to select a range of sites, pollutants
and periods (see examples below). Second, storing the data as .RData objects
is very efficient as they are about four times smaller than .csv files ---
which means the data downloads quickly and saves bandwidth. Third, the
function completely avoids any need for data manipulation or setting time
formats, time zones etc. Finally, it is easy to import many years of data
beyond the current limit of about 64,000 lines. The final point makes it
possible to download several long time series in one go. The function also
has the advantage that the proper site name is imported and used in
\code{openair} functions.

The site codes and pollutant names can be upper or lower case. The function
will issue a warning when data less than six months old is downloaded, which
may not be ratified.

The data are imported by stacking sites on top of one another and will have
field names \code{date}, \code{site}, \code{code} (the site code) and
pollutant(s). Sometimes it is useful to have columns of site data. This can
be done using the \code{reshape} function --- see examples below.

The situation for particle measurements is not straightforward given the
variety of methods used to measure particle mass and changes in their use
over time. The \code{importKCL} function imports two measures of PM10 where
available. \code{PM10_raw} are TEOM measurements with a 1.3 factor applied
to take account of volatile losses. The \code{PM10} data is a current best
estimate of a gravimetric equivalent measure as described below. NOTE! many
sites have several instruments that measure PM10 or PM2.5. In the case of
FDMS measurements, these are given as separate site codes (see below). For
example "MY1" will be TEOM with VCM applied and "MY7" is the FDMS data.

Where FDMS data are used the volatile and non-volatile components are
separately reported i.e. v10 = volatile PM10, v2.5 = volatile PM2.5, nv10 =
non-volatile PM10 and nv2.5 = non-volatile PM2.5. Therefore, PM10 = v10 +
nv10 and PM2.5 = v2.5 + nv2.5.

For the assessment of the EU Limit Values, PM10 needs to be measured using
the reference method or one shown to be equivalent to the reference method.
Defra carried out extensive trials between 2004 and 2006 to establish which
types of particulate analysers in use in the UK were equivalent. These
trials found that measurements made using Partisol, FDMS, BAM and SM200
instruments were shown to be equivalent to the PM10 reference method.
However, correction factors need to be applied to measurements from the
SM200 and BAM instruments. Importantly, the TEOM was demonstrated as not
being equivalent to the reference method due to the loss of volatile PM,
even when the 1.3 correction factor was applied.  The Volatile Correction
Model (VCM) was developed for Defra at King's to allow measurements of PM10
from TEOM instruments to be converted to reference equivalent; it uses the
measurements of volatile PM made using nearby FDMS instruments to correct
the measurements made by the TEOM. It passed the equivalence testing using
the same methodology used in the Defra trials and is now the recommended
method for correcting TEOM measurements (Defra, 2009). VCM correction of
TEOM measurements can only be applied after 1st January 2004, when
sufficiently widespread measurements of volatile PM became available. The
1.3 correction factor is now considered redundant for measurements of PM10
made after 1st January 2004.  Further information on the VCM can be found at
\url{http://www.volatile-correction-model.info/}.

All PM10 statistics on the LondonAir web site, including the bulletins and
statistical tools (and in the RData objects downloaded using
\code{importKCL}), now report PM10 results as reference equivalent. For PM10
measurements made by BAM and SM200 analysers the applicable correction
factors have been applied. For measurements from TEOM analysers the 1.3
factor has been applied up to 1st January 2004, then the VCM method has been
used to convert to reference equivalent.

The meteorological data are meant to represent 'typical' conditions in
London, but users may prefer to use their own data. The data provide a an
estimate of general meteorological conditions across Greater London. For
meteorological species (wd, ws, rain, solar) each data point is formed by
averaging measurements from a subset of LAQN monitoring sites that have been
identified as having minimal disruption from local obstacles and a long term
reliable dataset. The exact sites used varies between species, but include
between two and five sites per species. Therefore, the data should represent
'London scale' meteorology, rather than local conditions.

While the function is being developed, the following site codes should help
with selection. We will also make available other meta data such as site
type and location to make it easier to select sites based on other
information. Note that these codes need to be refined because only the
common species are available for export currently i.e. NOx, NO2, O3, CO,
SO2, PM10, PM2.5.
