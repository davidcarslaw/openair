\item{year}{Year or years to import. To import a sequence of years from
1990 to 2000 use \code{year = 1990:2000}. To import several specific years
use \code{year = c(1990, 1995, 2000)} for example.}

\description{
Function to import pre-calculated back trajectories using the NOAA HYSPLIT
model. The trajectories have been calculated for a select range of locations
which will expand in time. They cover the last 20 years or so and can be used
together with other \code{openair} functions.
}
\details{
This function imports pre-calculated back trajectories using the HYSPLIT
trajectory model (Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory
Model. Back trajectories provide some very useful information for air quality
data analysis. However, while they are commonly calculated by researchers it
is generally difficult for them to be calculated on a routine basis and used
easily. In addition, the availability of back trajectories over several years
can be very useful, but again difficult to calculate.

Trajectories are run at 3-hour intervals and stored in yearly files (see
below). The trajectories are started at ground-level (10m) and propagated
backwards in time.

These trajectories have been calculated using the Global NOAA-NCEP/NCAR
reanalysis data archives. The global data are on a latitude-longitude grid
(2.5 degree). Note that there are many different meteorological data sets
that can be used to run HYSPLIT e.g. including ECMWF data. However, in order
to make it practicable to run and store trajectories for many years and
sites, the NOAA-NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data is most useful. In addition, these
archives are available for use widely, which is not the case for many other
data sets e.g. ECMWF. HYSPLIT calculated trajectories based on archive data
may be distributed without permission. For those wanting, for example, to
consider higher resolution meteorological data sets it may be better to run
the trajectories separately.

We are extremely grateful to NOAA for making HYSPLIT available to produce
back trajectories in an open way. We ask that you cite HYSPLIT if used in
published work.

Users can supply their own trajectory files to plot in openair. These files
must have the following fields: date, lat, lon and hour.inc (see details
below).

The files consist of the following information:

\describe{ \item{date}{This is the arrival point time and is repeated the
number of times equal to the length of the back trajectory --- typically 96
hours (except early on in the file). The format is \code{POSIXct}. It is this
field that should be used to link with air quality data. See example below.}
\item{receptor}{Receptor number, currently only 1.} \item{year}{The year}
\item{month}{Month 1-12} \item{day}{Day of the month 1-31} \item{hour}{Hour
of the day 0-23 GMT} \item{hour.inc}{Number of hours back in time e.g. 0 to
-96.} \item{lat}{Latitude in decimal format.}  \item{lon}{Longitude in
decimal format.}  \item{height}{Height of trajectory (m).}
\item{pressure}{Pressure of trajectory (kPa).}  }
}
\note{
The trajectories were run using the February 2011 HYSPLIT model.
The function is primarily written to investigate a single
site at a time for a single year. The trajectory files are quite
large and care should be exercised when importing several years and/or sites.

## import trajectory data for London in 2009
\dontrun{mytraj <- importTraj(site = "london", year = 2009)}

## combine with measurements
\dontrun{theData <- importAURN(site = "kc1", year = 2009)
