#' Pollution rose variation of the traditional wind rose plot
#'
#' The traditional wind rose plot that plots wind speed and wind direction by
#' different intervals. The pollution rose applies the same plot structure but
#' substitutes other measurements, most commonly a pollutant time series, for
#' wind speed.
#'
#' [pollutionRose()] is a [windRose()] wrapper which brings \code{pollutant}
#' forward in the argument list, and attempts to sensibly rescale break points
#' based on the \code{pollutant} data range by by-passing \code{ws.int}.
#'
#' By default, [pollutionRose()] will plot a pollution rose of \code{nox} using
#' "wedge" style segments and placing the scale key to the right of the plot.
#'
#' It is possible to compare two wind speed-direction data sets using
#' [pollutionRose()]. There are many reasons for doing so e.g. to see how one
#' site compares with another or for meteorological model evaluation. In this
#' case, \code{ws} and \code{wd} are considered to the the reference data sets
#' with which a second set of wind speed and wind directions are to be compared
#' (\code{ws2} and \code{wd2}). The first set of values is subtracted from the
#' second and the differences compared. If for example, \code{wd2} was biased
#' positive compared with \code{wd} then \code{pollutionRose} will show the bias
#' in polar coordinates. In its default use, wind direction bias is colour-coded
#' to show negative bias in one colour and positive bias in another.
#'
#' @inheritParams windRose
#' @param pollutant Mandatory. A pollutant name corresponding to a variable in a
#'   data frame should be supplied e.g. \code{pollutant = "nox"}.
#' @param breaks Most commonly, the number of break points for pollutant
#'   concentrations. The default, 6, attempts to breaks the supplied data at
#'   approximately 6 sensible break points. However, \code{breaks} can also be
#'   used to set specific break points. For example, the argument \code{breaks =
#'   c(0, 1, 10, 100)} breaks the data into segments <1, 1-10, 10-100, >100.
#' @inheritDotParams windRose -pollutant -key.footer -key.position -key -breaks
#'   -paddle -seg -normalise -plot
#' @export
#' @return an [openair][openair-package] object. Summarised proportions can be
#'   extracted directly using the \code{$data} operator, e.g.
#'   \code{object$data} for \code{output <- windRose(mydata)}. This returns a
#'   data frame with three set columns: \code{cond}, conditioning based on
#'   \code{type}; \code{wd}, the wind direction; and \code{calm}, the
#'   \code{statistic} for the proportion of data unattributed to any specific
#'   wind direction because it was collected under calm conditions; and then
#'   several (one for each range binned for the plot) columns giving proportions
#'   of measurements associated with each \code{ws} or \code{pollutant} range
#'   plotted as a discrete panel.

#' Traditional wind rose plot
#'
#' The traditional wind rose plot that plots wind speed and wind direction by
#' different intervals. The pollution rose applies the same plot structure but
#' substitutes other measurements, most commonly a pollutant time series, for
#' wind speed.
#'
#' For \code{windRose} data are summarised by direction, typically by 45 or 30
#' (or 10) degrees and by different wind speed categories. Typically, wind
#' speeds are represented by different width "paddles". The plots show the
#' proportion (here represented as a percentage) of time that the wind is from a
#' certain angle and wind speed range.
#'
#' By default \code{windRose} will plot a windRose in using "paddle" style
#' segments and placing the scale key below the plot.
#'
#' The argument \code{pollutant} uses the same plotting structure but
#' substitutes another data series, defined by \code{pollutant}, for wind speed.
#' It is recommended to use [pollutionRose()] for plotting pollutant
#' concentrations.
#'
#' The option \code{statistic = "prop.mean"} provides a measure of the relative
#' contribution of each bin to the panel mean, and is intended for use with
#' \code{pollutionRose}.
#'
#' @param mydata A data frame containing fields \code{ws} and \code{wd}
#' @param ws Name of the column representing wind speed.
#' @param wd Name of the column representing wind direction.
#' @param ws2,wd2 The user can supply a second set of wind speed and wind
#'   direction values with which the first can be compared. See
#'   [pollutionRose()] for more details.
#' @param ws.int The Wind speed interval. Default is 2 m/s but for low met masts
#'   with low mean wind speeds a value of 1 or 0.5 m/s may be better.
#' @param angle Default angle of \dQuote{spokes} is 30. Other potentially useful
#'   angles are 45 and 10. Note that the width of the wind speed interval may
#'   need adjusting using \code{width}.
#' @param type \code{type} determines how the data are split i.e. conditioned,
#'   and then plotted. The default is will produce a single plot using the
#'   entire data. Type can be one of the built-in types as detailed in
#'   \code{cutData} e.g. \dQuote{season}, \dQuote{year}, \dQuote{weekday} and so
#'   on. For example, \code{type = "season"} will produce four plots --- one for
#'   each season.
#'
#'   It is also possible to choose \code{type} as another variable in the data
#'   frame. If that variable is numeric, then the data will be split into four
#'   quantiles (if possible) and labelled accordingly. If type is an existing
#'   character or factor variable, then those categories/levels will be used
#'   directly. This offers great flexibility for understanding the variation of
#'   different variables and how they depend on one another.
#'
#'   Type can be up length two e.g. \code{type = c("season", "weekday")} will
#'   produce a 2x2 plot split by season and day of the week. Note, when two
#'   types are provided the first forms the columns and the second the rows.
#' @param calm.thresh By default, conditions are considered to be calm when the
#'   wind speed is zero. The user can set a different threshold for calms be
#'   setting \code{calm.thresh} to a higher value. For example,
#'   \code{calm.thresh = 0.5} will identify wind speeds **below** 0.5 as calm.
#' @param bias.corr When \code{angle} does not divide exactly into 360 a bias is
#'   introduced in the frequencies when the wind direction is already supplied
#'   rounded to the nearest 10 degrees, as is often the case. For example, if
#'   \code{angle = 22.5}, N, E, S, W will include 3 wind sectors and all other
#'   angles will be two. A bias correction can made to correct for this problem.
#'   A simple method according to Applequist (2012) is used to adjust the
#'   frequencies.
#' @param cols Colours to be used for plotting. Options include
#'   \dQuote{default}, \dQuote{increment}, \dQuote{heat}, \dQuote{jet},
#'   \dQuote{hue} and user defined. For user defined the user can supply a list
#'   of colour names recognised by R (type \code{colours()} to see the full
#'   list). An example would be \code{cols = c("yellow", "green", "blue",
#'   "black")}.
#' @param grid.line Grid line interval to use. If \code{NULL}, as in default,
#'   this is assigned based on the available data range. However, it can also be
#'   forced to a specific value, e.g. \code{grid.line = 10}. \code{grid.line}
#'   can also be a list to control the interval, line type and colour. For
#'   example \code{grid.line = list(value = 10, lty = 5, col = "purple")}.
#' @param width For \code{paddle = TRUE}, the adjustment factor for width of
#'   wind speed intervals. For example, \code{width = 1.5} will make the paddle
#'   width 1.5 times wider.
#' @param seg When \code{paddle = TRUE}, \code{seg} determines with width of the
#'   segments. For example, \code{seg = 0.5} will produce segments 0.5 *
#'   \code{angle}.
#' @param auto.text Either \code{TRUE} (default) or \code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE}
#'   titles and axis labels will automatically try and format pollutant names
#'   and units properly, e.g., by subscripting the \sQuote{2} in NO2.
#' @param breaks Most commonly, the number of break points for wind speed. With
#'   the \code{ws.int} default of 2 m/s, the \code{breaks} default, 4, generates
#'   the break points 2, 4, 6, 8 m/s. However, \code{breaks} can also be used to
#'   set specific break points. For example, the argument \code{breaks = c(0, 1,
#'   10, 100)} breaks the data into segments <1, 1-10, 10-100, >100.
#' @param offset The size of the 'hole' in the middle of the plot, expressed as
#'   a percentage of the polar axis scale, default 10.
#' @param normalise If \code{TRUE} each wind direction segment is normalised to
#'   equal one. This is useful for showing how the concentrations (or other
#'   parameters) contribute to each wind sector when the proportion of time the
#'   wind is from that direction is low. A line showing the probability that the
#'   wind directions is from a particular wind sector is also shown.
#' @param max.freq Controls the scaling used by setting the maximum value for
#'   the radial limits. This is useful to ensure several plots use the same
#'   radial limits.
#' @param paddle Either \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE} plots rose
#'   using 'paddle' style spokes. If \code{FALSE} plots rose using 'wedge' style
#'   spokes.
#' @param key.header Adds additional text/labels above the scale key. For
#'   example, passing \code{windRose(mydata, key.header = "ws")} adds the
#'   addition text as a scale header. Note: This argument is passed to
#'   [drawOpenKey()] via [quickText()], applying the auto.text argument, to
#'   handle formatting.
#' @param key.footer Adds additional text/labels below the scale key. See
#'   \code{key.header} for further information.
#' @param key.position Location where the scale key is to plotted. Allowed
#'   arguments currently include \dQuote{top}, \dQuote{right}, \dQuote{bottom}
#'   and \dQuote{left}.
#' @param key Fine control of the scale key via [drawOpenKey()].
#' @param dig.lab The number of significant figures at which scientific number
#'   formatting is used in break point and key labelling. Default 5.
#' @param include.lowest Logical. If \code{FALSE} (the default), the first
#'   interval will be left exclusive and right inclusive. If \code{TRUE}, the
#'   first interval will be left and right inclusive. Passed to the
#'   \code{include.lowest} argument of [cut()].
#' @param statistic The \code{statistic} to be applied to each data bin in the
#'   plot. Options currently include \dQuote{prop.count}, \dQuote{prop.mean} and
#'   \dQuote{abs.count}. The default \dQuote{prop.count} sizes bins according to
#'   the proportion of the frequency of measurements.  Similarly,
#'   \dQuote{prop.mean} sizes bins according to their relative contribution to
#'   the mean. \dQuote{abs.count} provides the absolute count of measurements in
#'   each bin.
#' @param pollutant Alternative data series to be sampled instead of wind speed.
#'   The [windRose()] default NULL is equivalent to \code{pollutant = "ws"}. Use
#'   in [pollutionRose()].
#' @param annotate If \code{TRUE} then the percentage calm and mean values are
#'   printed in each panel together with a description of the statistic below
#'   the plot. If \code{" "} then only the statistic is below the plot. Custom
#'   annotations may be added by setting value to \code{c("annotation 1",
#'   "annotation 2")}.
#' @param angle.scale The scale is by default shown at a 315 degree angle.
#'   Sometimes the placement of the scale may interfere with an interesting
#'   feature. The user can therefore set \code{angle.scale} to another value
#'   (between 0 and 360 degrees) to mitigate such problems. For example
#'   \code{angle.scale = 45} will draw the scale heading in a NE direction.
#' @param border Border colour for shaded areas. Default is no border.
#' @param alpha The alpha transparency to use for the plotting surface (a value
#'   between 0 and 1 with zero being fully transparent and 1 fully opaque).
#'   Setting a value below 1 can be useful when plotting surfaces on a map using
#'   the package \code{openairmaps}.
#' @param plot Should a plot be produced? \code{FALSE} can be useful when
#'   analysing data to extract plot components and plotting them in other ways.
#' @param ... Other parameters that are passed on to \code{drawOpenKey},
#'   \code{lattice:xyplot} and \code{cutData}. Axis and title labelling options
#'   (\code{xlab}, \code{ylab}, \code{main}) are passed to \code{xyplot} via
#'   \code{quickText} to handle routine formatting.
#'
#' @export
#' @import dplyr
#' @return an [openair][openair-package] object. Summarised proportions can be
#'   extracted directly using the \code{$data} operator, e.g. \code{object$data}
#'   for \code{output <- windRose(mydata)}. This returns a data frame with three
#'   set columns: \code{cond}, conditioning based on \code{type}; \code{wd}, the
#'   wind direction; and \code{calm}, the \code{statistic} for the proportion of
#'   data unattributed to any specific wind direction because it was collected
#'   under calm conditions; and then several (one for each range binned for the
#'   plot) columns giving proportions of measurements associated with each
#'   \code{ws} or \code{pollutant} range plotted as a discrete panel.
#' @note \code{windRose} and \code{pollutionRose} both use [drawOpenKey()] to
