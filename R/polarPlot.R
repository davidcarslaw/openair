#' Function for plotting bivariate polar plots with smoothing.
#'
#' Function for plotting pollutant concentration in polar coordinates showing
#' concentration by wind speed (or another numeric variable) and direction. Mean
#' concentrations are calculated for wind speed-direction \sQuote{bins} (e.g.
#' 0-1, 1-2 m/s,...  and 0-10, 10-20 degrees etc.).  To aid interpretation,
#' \code{gam} smoothing is carried out using \code{mgcv}.
#'
#' The bivariate polar plot is a useful diagnostic tool for quickly gaining an
#' idea of potential sources. Wind speed is one of the most useful variables to
#' use to separate source types (see references). For example, ground-level
#' concentrations resulting from buoyant plumes from chimney stacks tend to peak
#' under higher wind speed conditions. Conversely, ground-level, non-buoyant
#' plumes such as from road traffic, tend to have highest concentrations under
#' low wind speed conditions. Other sources such as from aircraft engines also
#' show differing characteristics by wind speed.
#'
#' The function has been developed to allow variables other than wind speed to
#' be plotted with wind direction in polar coordinates. The key issue is that
#' the other variable plotted against wind direction should be discriminating in
#' some way. For example, temperature can help reveal high-level sources brought
#' down to ground level in unstable atmospheric conditions, or show the effect a
#' source emission dependent on temperature e.g. biogenic isoprene.
#'
#' The plots can vary considerably depending on how much smoothing is done.  The
#' approach adopted here is based on the very flexible and capable \code{mgcv}
#' package that uses \emph{Generalized Additive Models}. While methods do exist
#' to find an optimum level of smoothness, they are not necessarily useful. The
#' principal aim of \code{polarPlot} is as a graphical analysis rather than for
#' quantitative purposes. In this respect the smoothing aims to strike a balance
#' between revealing interesting (real) features and overly noisy data. The
#' defaults used in [polarPlot()] are based on the analysis of data from many
#' different sources. More advanced users may wish to modify the code and adopt
#' other smoothing approaches.
#'
#' Various statistics are possible to consider e.g. mean, maximum, median.
#' \code{statistic = "max"} is often useful for revealing sources. Pair-wise
#' statistics between two pollutants can also be calculated.
#'
#' The function can also be used to compare two pollutant species through a
#' range of pair-wise statistics (see help on \code{statistic}) and Grange et
#' al. (2016) (open-access publication link below).
#'
#' Wind direction is split up into 10 degree intervals and the other variable
#' (e.g. wind speed) 30 intervals. These 2D bins are then used to calculate the
#' statistics.
#'
#' These plots often show interesting features at higher wind speeds (see
#' references below). For these conditions there can be very few measurements
#' and therefore greater uncertainty in the calculation of the surface. There
#' are several ways in which this issue can be tackled. First, it is possible to
#' avoid smoothing altogether and use [polarFreq()]. Second, the effect of
#' setting a minimum number of measurements in each wind speed-direction bin can
#' be examined through \code{min.bin}. It is possible that a single point at
#' high wind speed conditions can strongly affect the surface prediction.
#' Therefore, setting \code{min.bin = 3}, for example, will remove all wind
#' speed-direction bins with fewer than 3 measurements \emph{before} fitting the
#' surface. Third, consider setting \code{uncertainty = TRUE}. This option will
#' show the predicted surface together with upper and lower 95% confidence
#' intervals, which take account of the frequency of measurements.
#'
#' Variants on \code{polarPlot} include [polarAnnulus()] and [polarFreq()].
#'
#' @param mydata A data frame minimally containing \code{wd}, another variable
#'   to plot in polar coordinates (the default is a column \dQuote{ws} --- wind
#'   speed) and a pollutant. Should also contain \code{date} if plots by time
#'   period are required.
#'
#' @param pollutant Mandatory. A pollutant name corresponding to a variable in a
#'   data frame should be supplied e.g. \code{pollutant = "nox"}. There can also
#'   be more than one pollutant specified e.g. \code{pollutant = c("nox",
#'   "no2")}. The main use of using two or more pollutants is for model
#'   evaluation where two species would be expected to have similar
#'   concentrations. This saves the user stacking the data and it is possible to
#'   work with columns of data directly. A typical use would be \code{pollutant
#'   = c("obs", "mod")} to compare two columns \dQuote{obs} (the observations)
#'   and \dQuote{mod} (modelled values). When pair-wise statistics such as
#'   Pearson correlation and regression techniques are to be plotted,
#'   \code{pollutant} takes two elements too. For example, \code{pollutant =
#'   c("bc", "pm25")} where \code{"bc"} is a function of \code{"pm25"}.
#'
#' @param x Name of variable to plot against wind direction in polar
#'   coordinates, the default is wind speed, \dQuote{ws}.
#'
#' @param wd Name of wind direction field.
#'
#' @param type \code{type} determines how the data are split i.e. conditioned,
#'   and then plotted. The default is will produce a single plot using the
#'   entire data. Type can be one of the built-in types as detailed in
#'   \code{cutData} e.g. \dQuote{season}, \dQuote{year}, \dQuote{weekday} and so
#'   on. For example, \code{type = "season"} will produce four plots --- one for
#'   each season.
#'
#'   It is also possible to choose \code{type} as another variable in the data
#'   frame. If that variable is numeric, then the data will be split into four
#'   quantiles (if possible) and labelled accordingly. If type is an existing
#'   character or factor variable, then those categories/levels will be used
#'   directly. This offers great flexibility for understanding the variation of
#'   different variables and how they depend on one another.
#'
#'   Type can be up length two e.g. \code{type = c("season", "weekday")} will
#'   produce a 2x2 plot split by season and day of the week. Note, when two
#'   types are provided the first forms the columns and the second the rows.
#'
#' @param statistic The statistic that should be applied to each wind
#'   speed/direction bin. Because of the smoothing involved, the colour scale
#'   for some of these statistics is only to provide an indication of overall
#'   pattern and should not be interpreted in concentration units e.g. for
#'   \code{statistic = "weighted.mean"} where the bin mean is multiplied by the
#'   bin frequency and divided by the total frequency. In many cases using
#'   \code{polarFreq} will be better. Setting \code{statistic = "weighted.mean"}
#'   can be useful because it provides an indication of the concentration *
#'   frequency of occurrence and will highlight the wind speed/direction
#'   conditions that dominate the overall mean.Can be:
#'
#'   \itemize{ \item  \dQuote{mean} (default), \dQuote{median}, \dQuote{max}
#'   (maximum), \dQuote{frequency}. \dQuote{stdev} (standard deviation),
#'   \dQuote{weighted.mean}.
#'
#'   \item \code{statistic = "nwr"} Implements the Non-parametric Wind
#'   Regression approach of Henry et al. (2009) that uses kernel smoothers. The
#'   \code{openair} implementation is not identical because Gaussian kernels are
#'   used for both wind direction and speed. The smoothing is controlled by
#'   \code{ws_spread} and \code{wd_spread}.
#'
#'   \item \code{statistic = "cpf"} the conditional probability function (CPF)
#'   is plotted and a single (usually high) percentile level is supplied. The
#'   CPF is defined as CPF = my/ny, where my is the number of samples in the y
#'   bin (by default a wind direction, wind speed interval) with mixing ratios
#'   greater than the \emph{overall} percentile concentration, and ny is the
#'   total number of samples in the same wind sector (see Ashbaugh et al.,
#'   1985). Note that percentile intervals can also be considered; see
#'   \code{percentile} for details.
#'
#'   \item When \code{statistic = "r"} or \code{statistic = "Pearson"}, the
#'   Pearson correlation coefficient is calculated for \emph{two} pollutants.
#'   The calculation involves a weighted Pearson correlation coefficient, which
#'   is weighted by Gaussian kernels for wind direction an the radial variable
#'   (by default wind speed). More weight is assigned to values close to a wind
#'   speed-direction interval. Kernel weighting is used to ensure that all data
#'   are used rather than relying on the potentially small number of values in a
#'   wind speed-direction interval.
#'
#'   \item When \code{statistic = "Spearman"}, the Spearman correlation
#'   coefficient is calculated for \emph{two} pollutants. The calculation
#'   involves a weighted Spearman correlation coefficient, which is weighted by
#'   Gaussian kernels for wind direction an the radial variable (by default wind
#'   speed). More weight is assigned to values close to a wind speed-direction
#'   interval. Kernel weighting is used to ensure that all data are used rather
#'   than relying on the potentially small number of values in a wind
#'   speed-direction interval.
#'
#'   \item \code{"robust_slope"} is another option for pair-wise statistics and
#'   \code{"quantile.slope"}, which uses quantile regression to estimate the
#'   slope for a particular quantile level (see also \code{tau} for setting the
#'   quantile level).
#'
#'   \item \code{"york_slope"} is another option for pair-wise statistics which
#'   uses the \emph{York regression method} to estimate the slope. In this
#'   method the uncertainties in \code{x} and \code{y} are used in the
#'   determination of the slope. The uncertainties are provided by
#'   \code{x_error} and \code{y_error} --- see below.}
#'
#' @param limits The function does its best to choose sensible limits
#'   automatically. However, there are circumstances when the user will wish to
#'   set different ones. An example would be a series of plots showing each year
#'   of data separately. The limits are set in the form \code{c(lower, upper)},
#'   so \code{limits = c(0, 100)} would force the plot limits to span 0-100.
#'
#' @param exclude.missing Setting this option to \code{TRUE} (the default)
#'   removes points from the plot that are too far from the original data. The
#'   smoothing routines will produce predictions at points where no data exist
#'   i.e. they predict. By removing the points too far from the original data
#'   produces a plot where it is clear where the original data lie. If set to
#'   \code{FALSE} missing data will be interpolated.
#'
#' @param uncertainty Should the uncertainty in the calculated surface be shown?
#'   If \code{TRUE} three plots are produced on the same scale showing the
#'   predicted surface together with the estimated lower and upper uncertainties
#'   at the 95% confidence interval. Calculating the uncertainties is useful to
#'   understand whether features are real or not.  For example, at high wind
#'   speeds where there are few data there is greater uncertainty over the
#'   predicted values. The uncertainties are calculated using the GAM and
#'   weighting is done by the frequency of measurements in each wind
#'   speed-direction bin. Note that if uncertainties are calculated then the
#'   type is set to "default".
#'
#' @param percentile If \code{statistic = "percentile"} then \code{percentile}
#'   is used, expressed from 0 to 100. Note that the percentile value is
#'   calculated in the wind speed, wind direction \sQuote{bins}. For this reason
#'   it can also be useful to set \code{min.bin} to ensure there are a
#'   sufficient number of points available to estimate a percentile. See
#'   \code{quantile} for more details of how percentiles are calculated.
#'
#'   \code{percentile} is also used for the Conditional Probability Function
#'   (CPF) plots. \code{percentile} can be of length two, in which case the
#'   percentile \emph{interval} is considered for use with CPF. For example,
#'   \code{percentile = c(90, 100)} will plot the CPF for concentrations between
#'   the 90 and 100th percentiles. Percentile intervals can be useful for
#'   identifying specific sources. In addition, \code{percentile} can also be of
#'   length 3. The third value is the \sQuote{trim} value to be applied. When
#'   calculating percentile intervals many can cover very low values where there
#'   is no useful information. The trim value ensures that values greater than
#'   or equal to the trim * mean value are considered \emph{before} the
#'   percentile intervals are calculated. The effect is to extract more detail
#'   from many source signatures. See the manual for examples. Finally, if the
#'   trim value is less than zero the percentile range is interpreted as
#'   absolute concentration values and subsetting is carried out directly.
#'
#' @param cols Colours to be used for plotting. Options include
#'   \dQuote{default}, \dQuote{increment}, \dQuote{heat}, \dQuote{jet} and
#'   \code{RColorBrewer} colours --- see the \code{openair} \code{openColours}
#'   function for more details. For user defined the user can supply a list of
#'   colour names recognised by R (type \code{colours()} to see the full list).
#'   An example would be \code{cols = c("yellow", "green", "blue")}. \code{cols}
#'   can also take the values \code{"viridis"}, \code{"magma"},
#'   \code{"inferno"}, or \code{"plasma"} which are the viridis colour maps
#'   ported from Python's Matplotlib library.
#'
#' @param weights At the edges of the plot there may only be a few data points
#'   in each wind speed-direction interval, which could in some situations
#'   distort the plot if the concentrations are high. \code{weights} applies a
#'   weighting to reduce their influence. For example and by default if only a
#'   single data point exists then the weighting factor is 0.25 and for two
#'   points 0.5. To not apply any weighting and use the data as is, use
#'   \code{weights = c(1, 1, 1)}.
#'
#'   An alternative to down-weighting these points they can be removed
#'   altogether using \code{min.bin}.
#'
#' @param min.bin The minimum number of points allowed in a wind speed/wind
#'   direction bin.  The default is 1. A value of two requires at least 2 valid
#'   records in each bin an so on; bins with less than 2 valid records are set
#'   to NA. Care should be taken when using a value > 1 because of the risk of
#'   removing real data points. It is recommended to consider your data with
#'   care. Also, the \code{polarFreq} function can be of use in such
#'   circumstances.
#'
#' @param mis.col When \code{min.bin} is > 1 it can be useful to show where data
#'   are removed on the plots. This is done by shading the missing data in
#'   \code{mis.col}. To not highlight missing data when \code{min.bin} > 1
#'   choose \code{mis.col = "transparent"}.
#'
#' @param alpha The alpha transparency to use for the plotting surface (a value
#'   between 0 and 1 with zero being fully transparent and 1 fully opaque).
#'   Setting a value below 1 can be useful when plotting surfaces on a map using
#'   the package \code{openairmaps}.
#'
#' @param upper This sets the upper limit wind speed to be used. Often there are
#'   only a relatively few data points at very high wind speeds and plotting all
#'   of them can reduce the useful information in the plot.
#'
#' @param angle.scale Sometimes the placement of the scale may interfere with an
#'   interesting feature. The user can therefore set \code{angle.scale} to any
#'   value between 0 and 360 degrees to mitigate such problems. For example
#'   \code{angle.scale = 45} will draw the scale heading in a NE direction.
#'
#' @param units The units shown on the polar axis scale.
#'
#' @param force.positive The default is \code{TRUE}. Sometimes if smoothing data
#'   with steep gradients it is possible for predicted values to be negative.
#'   \code{force.positive = TRUE} ensures that predictions remain positive. This
#'   is useful for several reasons. First, with lots of missing data more
#'   interpolation is needed and this can result in artefacts because the
#'   predictions are too far from the original data. Second, if it is known
#'   beforehand that the data are all positive, then this option carries that
#'   assumption through to the prediction. The only likely time where setting
#'   \code{force.positive = FALSE} would be if background concentrations were
#'   first subtracted resulting in data that is legitimately negative. For the
#'   vast majority of situations it is expected that the user will not need to
#'   alter the default option.
#'
#' @param k This is the smoothing parameter used by the \code{gam} function in
#'   package \code{mgcv}. Typically, value of around 100 (the default) seems to
#'   be suitable and will resolve important features in the plot. The most
#'   appropriate choice of \code{k} is problem-dependent; but extensive testing
#'   of polar plots for many different problems suggests a value of \code{k} of
#'   about 100 is suitable. Setting \code{k} to higher values will not tend to
#'   affect the surface predictions by much but will add to the computation
#'   time. Lower values of \code{k} will increase smoothing. Sometimes with few
#'   data to plot \code{polarPlot} will fail. Under these circumstances it can
#'   be worth lowering the value of \code{k}.
#'
#' @param normalise If \code{TRUE} concentrations are normalised by dividing by
#'   their mean value. This is done \emph{after} fitting the smooth surface.
#'   This option is particularly useful if one is interested in the patterns of
#'   concentrations for several pollutants on different scales e.g. NOx and CO.
#'   Often useful if more than one \code{pollutant} is chosen.
#'
#' @param key.header Adds additional text/labels to the scale key. For example,
#'   passing the options \code{key.header = "header", key.footer = "footer1"}
#'   adds addition text above and below the scale key. These arguments are
#'   passed to \code{drawOpenKey} via \code{quickText}, applying the
#'   \code{auto.text} argument, to handle formatting.
#'
#' @param key.footer see \code{key.footer}.
#'
#' @param key.position Location where the scale key is to plotted. Allowed
#'   arguments currently include \code{"top"}, \code{"right"}, \code{"bottom"}
#'   and \code{"left"}.
#'
#' @param key Fine control of the scale key via \code{drawOpenKey}. See
#'   \code{drawOpenKey} for further details.
#'
#' @param auto.text Either \code{TRUE} (default) or \code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE}
#'   titles and axis labels will automatically try and format pollutant names
#'   and units properly e.g.  by subscripting the `2' in NO2.
#'
#' @param ws_spread The value of sigma used for Gaussian kernel weighting of
#'   wind speed when \code{statistic = "nwr"} or when correlation and regression
#'   statistics are used such as \emph{r}. Default is \code{0.5}.
#'
#' @param wd_spread The value of sigma used for Gaussian kernel weighting of
#'   wind direction when \code{statistic = "nwr"} or when correlation and
#'   regression statistics are used such as \emph{r}. Default is \code{4}.
#'
#' @param x_error The \code{x} error / uncertainty used when \code{statistic =
#'   "york_slope"}.
#'
#' @param y_error The \code{y} error / uncertainty used when \code{statistic =
#'   "york_slope"}.
#'
#' @param kernel Type of kernel used for the weighting procedure for when
#'   correlation or regression techniques are used. Only \code{"gaussian"} is
#'   supported but this may be enhanced in the future.
#'
#' @param formula.label When pair-wise statistics such as regression slopes are
#'   calculated and plotted, should a formula label be displayed?
#'
#' @param tau The quantile to be estimated when \code{statistic} is set to
#'   \code{"quantile.slope"}. Default is \code{0.5} which is equal to the median
#'   and will be ignored if \code{"quantile.slope"} is not used.
#'
#' @param plot Should a plot be produced? \code{FALSE} can be useful when
#'   analysing data to extract plot components and plotting them in other ways.
#'
#' @param ... Other graphical parameters passed onto \code{lattice:levelplot}
#'   and \code{cutData}. For example, \code{polarPlot} passes the option
#'   \code{hemisphere = "southern"} on to \code{cutData} to provide southern
#'   (rather than default northern) hemisphere handling of \code{type =
#'   "season"}. Similarly, common axis and title labelling options (such as
#'   \code{xlab}, \code{ylab}, \code{main}) are passed to \code{levelplot} via
#'   \code{quickText} to handle routine formatting.
#'
#' @import lattice
#' @import mgcv
#' @return an [openair][openair-package] object. `data` contains four set
#'   columns: \code{cond}, conditioning based on \code{type}; \code{u} and

#'   the local \code{pollutant} estimate.
